5. Every member shall be polite and professional when giving feedback/criticism.
   1. All feedback and criticism shall be constructive.


## Workload
6. Every member shall understand that should there be an issue, they can contact the tutor at any time, but it must be discussed with the group first.
	1. If there is an issue, any group member can and should contact Dr. Sobhan Tehrani at sobhan.tehrani@roehampton.ac.uk.
7. Meetings will take place at least two (2) times a week, but preferably three (3) days, and should be attended by every member, unless otherwise stated.

8. Every member shall help each other with any given task, to a reasonable extent. The group was created and agreed upon beforehand.

10. There is a mini-brief every day in the group’s Whatsapp chat breaking down all of the work we have started or completed on the day.


## Attendance
11. Every member shall attend each weekly Software Engineering class (every Wednesday) and meetings within the week, unless there is a medical emergency, a valid reason for lack of attendance, and they must notify the group of their absence in a reasonable and timely manner.
	1. If a member of the group fails to attend three (3) or more sessions without valid reasoning accepted by the group and reasonable notice shall be reported to the tutor.
	2. If a member cannot attend in-person, it is recommended they be available to call to emulate their attendance to the lecture.
