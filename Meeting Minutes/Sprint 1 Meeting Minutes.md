**Sprint 1 Meeting Minutes**

Week 1

This week is dedicated to determining the group for the group project. Not much work at
all is done this week because we are still learning about the coursework and deciding on
our groups.

Week 2

This week is dedicated to getting everything for the project laid out and organized. The
member roles have been decided and individual workload is discussed. Meetings are
discussed and agreed upon. Our goal is to complete everything for Sprint 1 this week.
	
	Meeting 1 - 29 January
		Initial team meeting to discuss the milestones for the first sprint. We are aiming to
		complete everything as quickly as possible so that we have the most time to
		complete the rest of the work. We define team roles and also the individual roles
		for each position. We have created and agreed upon our group’s Code of Conduct
		and each member’s roles.
		
	Meeting 2 - 31 January
		We discussed the requirements for the submission for the first sprint, due 4 
		February. We ensured that we had everything set up in order to complete all of the 
		work that we need to submit for the first sprint.

	Meeting 3 - 1 February
	 	We started the product backlog as a group and began to discuss the requirements
	 	of the dockerfile, as none of us had any prior knowledge about the dockerfile.

Week 3

This week is dedicated to finalizing all of the work needed to complete the submission 
for the first sprint. There is not much work to do in general, but the initial setup and 
organization is important to set us up for success in the future weeks.
	
	Meeting 1 - 2 February
		We finished the first part of the product backlog and set up the organization for
		the rest of the product backlog.
		
	Meeting 2 - 3 February
		We finished the product backlog and also began researching the personas to create
		to completely understand the product backlog and the requirements of the
		customer. We have also properly begun working on the dockerfile for the project.

	Meeting 3 - 4 February
		We have finished everything to do with the first sprint, including creating the
		GitHub repository, creating necessary branches within it, creating the dockerfile,
		creating the product backlog, and creating the personas.
