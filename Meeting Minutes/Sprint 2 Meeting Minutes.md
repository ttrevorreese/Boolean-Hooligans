# Sprint 2 Meeting Minutes

## Week 4

This week is dedicated to cleaning up and fixing mistakes that took place in the first
sprint. We now have a clearer understanding of the scope of the project and also how to
properly stay organized as a developer of this kind of project. We are now starting to
utilize the proper tools to stay organized in this environment.

	Meeting 1 - 9 February
	 	We began the integration of the project with Zube.io, implementing the entire
		project to the software. Using Zube.io, we have implemented the use of Kanban
		boards and sprint boards.
		
	Meeting 2 - 11 February
	 	We began learning about the issues with GitHub and how they work with the
		integration of Zube.io, as well as how they help with the organization of tasks that
		need to be completed. We also discussed the organization of next week.

## Week 5

We are aiming to finish the work for Sprint 2 by the end of this week. We want to be done
with the work by the next lab session so we can get as much feedback from the customer
on as much work as possible. This includes the tasks as user stories, use cases defined,
and the use case diagram defined.
	
	Meeting 1 - 16 February
	 	We have thoroughly discussed the final tasks and how we should complete them
		and test that they all work as they should. The use cases, the use case diagram,
		and the tasks defined as user stories have all been discussed. Each member has
		been assigned and agreed on a task to finish up the work for the sprint.
	
	Meeting 2 - 18 February
	 	This week has been a check-in on the work that we are all meant to do for the
		final part of the sprint. We have finalized the workload for the sprint, as well as
		created a support system for the last of the work for the sprint. We have also
		organized the final meeting for the week, as well as the first meeting for the
		beginning of the next week to try to increase our teamwork.

	Meeting 3 - 20 February
	 	We have discussed our progress on the last sprint of the second sprint, ensuring
		we have all of the work done towards our checkpoints as a team. Progress is being
		made on the use cases and tasks as user stories. We have planned our next
		meeting, as well as our presentation for the next submission. We have the
		organization planned out for the rest of the sprint and the beginning of the next.

## Week 6

This week is dedicated to finalizing all of the work for Sprint 2, submit this work, and 
begin the work for Sprint 3 after our session on Wednesday, 23 February. We want to get 
as much final feedback from our customer as we can before submission, so we are going 
to discuss during the lab session with the customer about the work that we already have 
done.
	
	Meeting 1 - 21 February
	 	We began working on the outline of the presentation of our work for Sprint 2. We 
		have also finished the work for Sprint 2, besides the use case diagram. This will 
		be completed by the end of the week.
		
	Meeting 2 - 23 February
	 	We started the bulk of the work of the presentation of our work for Sprint 2. We 
		are finalizing the last pieces of the work to complete by the end of the sprint, and 
		we are looking to start the work for Sprint 3.

	Meeting 3 - 25 February
	 	After the work on the presentation, we began working on the diagrams, including
		the use case diagrams and the activity diagram. We plan to use these diagrams to
		present the general use of the program we are creating to the customer. These
		diagrams will help make our tasks more understandable to the customer(s), who
		may not have the same understanding of programming and software engineering.

## Week 7

This week is dedicated to finishing the work required for the Sprint 2 submission, as well
as beginning work for Sprint 3. The submission date has changed, therefore there is more
time to work on Sprint 2. We want to ensure we have the best work to our abilities to
submit.
	
	Meeting 1 - 28 February
	 	We continued work on the presentation for our work on Sprint 2. We helped each
		other set up our slides for the presentation, as well as double checked our work.
   	
	Meeting 2 - 02 March
	 	We began discussing the specifics of the work for Sprint 3, planning on truly
		starting once we submit the work for Sprint 2. We set up the Kanban/Sprint board
		so that we have all of the bits and pieces laid out and organized so we can
		visualize what needs to be done.
