# Sprint 3 Meeting Minutes

## Week 8

This week is beginning the bulk of the work for the project. The previous weeks
were more so dedicated to project setup and organization, but now is the beginning
of database design and web development. This is our focus for this week.

	Meeting 1 - 9 March
	 	After presenting our work to our customer thus far, we began discussing how we
		should approach the upcoming sprint. We discussed the PUG language for a bit,
		which is what we will be writing our website in. We also discussed how we should
		begin, and we decided that we will work on together simultaneously to get tasks
		done sooner, also reducing the review period.
		
	Meeting 2 - 10 March
		In this meeting, we started the work for this sprint. Last meeting was about
		setup and organization, but now we have started the work.

## Week 9

This week is the primary focus of the bulk of the work, beginning working more
on the work of developing the website, creating the database, and implementing
the database into the website.

	Meeting 1 - 14 March
		We discussed and researched the PUG language, as we will be creating the web
		front-end in this programming language. It is very similar to HTML, just a bit
		more simplified. We started familiarizing ourselves with the syntax of this
		language so we could provide the best possible website to our abilities.
		
	Meeting 2 - 16 March
		We had a short check-in meeting to see how we are progressing with everything,
		and we showed each other all of the work we had done in between our previous
		meeting and now. We continued to do our work and communicate as before.
		
	Meeting 3 - 18 March
		We began working with the database and working with the dataset given to us
		and ensuring we understand the aspects of it and how we need to work with it
		in order to provide the requirements of the customer.

## Week 10

This week is ...

	Meeting 1 - 20 March
		We had another check-in meeting where we discussed everything we have done in
		between this meeting and the last, and also began discussing the implementation
		of the database and the integration of testing using Travis CI.
		
	Meeting 2 - 21 March
		We had a short meeting to go over Travis CI and to also brainstorm new website
		layouts and themes.
		
	Meeting 3 - 23 March
		We had another short meeting to go over our progress thus far and the updates
		we have made to the website. There are new layouts for the website and we are
		working on full implementation with Travis CI to test our work.
