# Sprint 3 Meeting Minutes

## Week 8

This week is beginning the bulk of the work for the project. The previous weeks
were more so dedicated to project setup and organization, but now is the beginning
of database design and web development. This is our focus for this week.

	Meeting 1 - 9 March
	 	After presenting our work to our customer thus far, we began discussing how we
		should approach the upcoming sprint. We discussed the PUG language for a bit,
		which is what we will be writing our website in. We also discussed how we should
		begin, and we decided that we will work on together simultaneously to get tasks
		done sooner, also reducing the review period.
		
	Meeting 2 - 10 March
		In this meeting, we started the work for this sprint. Last meeting was about
		setup and organization, but now we have started the work.
