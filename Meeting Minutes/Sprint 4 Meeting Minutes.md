# Sprint 4 Meeting Minutes

Due to the interjection of Easter break in the midst of Sprint 4, the work
undertaken during this sprint was more sporadic and individual, due to a plethora
of individual personal circumstances that impaired our ability to work exactly
simultaneously during our break. We still met and communicated thoroughly
throughout the duration of the break in order to complete the work needed to
finish the project, but the meetings were less official.
