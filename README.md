This is the repository for the Software Engineering Group Coursework with the Boolean Hooligans at the University of Roehampton in Year 2 of the Computer Science BSc course.

## Project Scope
This project is aimed at creating an application for the _smooth_ and _efficient_ operation of a business.

The project will be worked on as a Scrum team, adopting both design methods (user stories, use cases) and project management methods (Agile, Kanban). Familiarization with Visual Studio, Git, and Docker is essential to the completion of this project. The end goal is to develop a CRUD application.

The project is largely focused on back-end organization and structure of the project and goals that are required to be met by a certain deadline. The aim is to emulate an interaction between a software engineering group and the customers and stakeholders of the product we are creating; therefore, Agile and Kanban philosophies are at the core of the project.

The organization this project is aimed towards requires reporting on population information. We have been tasked with designing and implementing a new system to allow easy access to population information. We are required to generate a multitude of different reports for the organization to access.
